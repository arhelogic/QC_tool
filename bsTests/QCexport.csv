23002443,"Adipocyte-derived soluble factor(s) inhibits early stages of B lymphopoiesis.","B lymphopoiesis declines with age, and in rabbits this occurs by 8 wk of age. We found that CFU fibroblasts (CFU-Fs) in the bone marrow (BM) decrease 10-fold by a few weeks of age and that the CFU-Fs preferentially differentiate into adipocytes instead of osteoblasts. BM becomes filled with fat spaces during this time, making rabbit a unique model to study the effects of accelerated fat accumulation on B lymphopoiesis. We show that adipocytes of both rabbit and human secrete a soluble factor(s) that inhibits B lymphopoiesis, and we tested if this inhibition was due to effects on the BM stroma or hematopoietic progenitors. Pretreatment of BM mononuclear cells with adipocyte conditioned medium dramatically inhibited their differentiation into proB cells in cocultures with OP9 stromal cells. In contrast, pretreatment of OP9 stromal cells with adipocyte conditioned medium had no effect on B lymphopoiesis. Using human hematopoietic stem cells, we show that inhibition by the adipocyte-derived factor occurred at the common lymphoid progenitor to preproB cell stage. We propose that the age-related decline in B lymphopoiesis is due to a decrease in CFU-Fs, an increase in adipocytes, and an adipocyte-derived factor that blocks B lymphopoiesis at the common lymphoid progenitor to preproB cell stage.","B lymphopoiesis"
20630094,"Incidence of the V600K mutation among melanoma patients with BRAF mutations, and potential therapeutic response to the specific BRAF inhibitor PLX4032.","Activating mutations in BRAF kinase are common in melanomas. Clinical trials with PLX4032, the mutant-BRAF inhibitor, show promising preliminary results in patients selected for the presence of V600E mutation. However, activating V600K mutation is the other most common mutation, yet patients with this variant are currently excluded from the PLX4032 trials. Here we present evidence that a patient bearing the BRAF V600K mutation responded remarkably to PLX4032, suggesting that clinical trials should include all patients with activating BRAF V600E/K mutations.","Melanoma, PLX4032"
22323876/,"EML4-ALK fusion gene in Korean non-small cell lung cancer.","A fusion gene between echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has been identified in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Although a few studies have evaluated EML4-ALK fusion genes in Korean NSCLCs, the prevalence of different EML4-ALK fusion variants has yet to be clearly assessed. Herein, we have examined the profiles of EML4-ALK fusion gene variants in Korean patients of NSCLCs. EML4-ALK fusion genes have been detected in 10 (6.0%) of 167 patients of NSCLCs and in 9 (7.4%) of 121 patients of adenocarcinoma. Of the 10 patients with fusion genes identified, 8 (80%) were E13;A20 (variant 1) and 2 (20%) were E6;A20, with an additional 33-bp sequence derived from intron 6 of EML4 (variant 3b). These results indicate that the profiles of EML4-ALK fusion gene variants in Korean patients of NSCLC may differ from those in other ethnic populations. Herein, we describe for the first time the profiles of EML4-ALK fusion variants of Korean patients with NSCLCs.","Anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase ALK, non-small cell lung cancer"
19147828,"EML4-ALK rearrangement in non-small cell lung cancer and non-tumor lung tissues.","A fusion gene, echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK), with transforming activity has recently been identified in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but its pathogenetic, diagnostic, and therapeutic roles remain unclear. Both frequency and type of EML4-ALK transcripts were investigated by reverse transcription PCR in 120 frozen NSCLC specimens from Italy and Spain; non-neoplastic lung tissues taken far from the tumor were used as controls. In cases carrying the fusion transcript, we determined EML4-ALK gene and protein levels using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation. We also analyzed ALK protein levels in paraffin samples from 662 NSCLC specimens, including the 120 cases investigated in the molecular studies. EML4-ALK transcripts (variants 1 and 3) were detected in 9 of 120 NSCLC samples but were not specific for NSCLC since they were also found in non-cancerous lung tissues taken far from the tumor. Notably, no transcripts were detected in matching tumor samples from these patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of cases expressing EML4-ALK transcripts showed that only a minority of cells harbored the EML4-ALK gene. None of these cases was found to express the EML4-ALK protein as examined by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation. The EML4-ALK transcript cannot be regarded as a specific diagnostic tool for NSCLC. Our results show therefore that the causal role and value of EML4-ALK as a therapeutic target remain to be defined.","Anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase ALK, non-small cell lung cancer, non-tumor lung tissues"
17190852,"A metabolomic comparison of urinary changes in type 2 diabetes in mouse, rat, and human.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the result of a combination of impaired insulin secretion with reduced insulin sensitivity of target tissues. There are an estimated 150 million affected individuals worldwide, of whom a large proportion remains undiagnosed because of a lack of specific symptoms early in this disorder and inadequate diagnostics. In this study, NMR-based metabolomic analysis in conjunction with multivariate statistics was applied to examine the urinary metabolic changes in two rodent models of type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as unmedicated human sufferers. The db/db mouse and obese Zucker (fa/fa) rat have autosomal recessive defects in the leptin receptor gene, causing type 2 diabetes. 1H-NMR spectra of urine were used in conjunction with uni- and multivariate statistics to identify disease-related metabolic changes in these two animal models and human sufferers. This study demonstrates metabolic similarities between the three species examined, including metabolic responses associated with general systemic stress, changes in the TCA cycle, and perturbations in nucleotide metabolism and in methylamine metabolism. All three species demonstrated profound changes in nucleotide metabolism, including that of N-methylnicotinamide and N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, which may provide unique biomarkers for following type 2 diabetes mellitus progression.","N-methylnicotinamide, type 2 diabetes"
11782391,"Human kallikrein 11: a new biomarker of prostate and ovarian carcinoma.","Human kallikrein 11 (hK11) is a putative serine protease of the human kallikrein gene family. Currently, no methods are available for measuring hK11 in biological fluids and tissues. Our aim was to develop immunological reagents and assays for measuring hK11 and examine if the concentration of this kallikrein is altered in disease states. We produced recombinant hK11 protein in a baculovirus system and used it to develop monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against hK11. We then developed an immunofluorometric procedure for measuring hK11 in biological fluids and tissue extracts with high sensitivity and specificity. We further quantified hK11 in various biological fluids and in serum of patients with various cancers. The hK11 immunofluorometric assay is highly sensitive (detection limit, 0.1 microg/l) and specific (no detectable cross-reactivity for other homologous kallikreins). We established the tissue expression pattern of hK11 at the protein level and found the highest levels in the prostate, followed by stomach, trachea, skin, and colon. We have immunohistochemically localized hK11 in epithelial cells of various organs. We further detected hK11 in amniotic fluid, milk of lactating women, cerebrospinal fluid, follicular fluid, and breast cancer cytosols. However, highest levels were seen in prostatic tissue extracts and seminal plasma. hK11 in seminal plasma and prostatic extracts is present at approximately 300-fold lower levels than prostate-specific antigen and at approximately the same levels as hK2. hK11 expression in breast cancer cell lines is up-regulated by estradiol. Elevated serum levels of hK11 were found in 70% of women with ovarian cancer and in 60% of men with prostate cancer. This is the first reported immunological assay for hK11. Analysis of this biomarker in serum may aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of ovarian and prostatic carcinoma.","hK11, Prostate Cancer"
23910705,"Serum cystatin C as a biomarker of cardiac diastolic dysfunction in patients with cardiac disease and preserved ejection fraction.","Diastolic dysfunction of the heart is correlated with cardiac mortality. Serum cystatin C (CysC) is an endogenous marker of kidney function. It is not clear whether serum CysC is associated with diastolic dysfunction in patients with varying cardiac conditions with concomitant diastolic abnormalities and preserved ejection fraction (EF). The authors measured serum CysC levels in patients with cardiac diseases and examined the relationships between serum CysC levels and diastolic function. Serum CysC was measured and echocardiography was performed in 124 consecutive patients with cardiac diseases. Transmitral flow (TMF) patterns surrogating diastolic function were categorized into two groups: a normal group and an abnormal group. Serum CysC and BNP showed a significant positive correlation. There were no significant differences in serum CysC among those cardiac diseases. Seventy-eight patients with cardiac disease and preserved EF (left ventricular EF &#8805;50%) and without renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate &#8805;60 mL/minute/1.73 m(2) ) were examined. Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that left atrium diameter and abnormal TMF patterns were independent determinants of serum CysC. Furthermore, patients with elevated serum CysC levels had poor prognosis. Serum CysC is associated with diastolic dysfunction in patients with various cardiac diseases and preserved EF. Serum CysC might be a biomarker of cardiac diastolic dysfunction in patients with preserved EF.","Cystatin-C CST3, Acute Kidney Injury, Coronary artery disease (CAD), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)"
